          <p>
            I started working at Crowdcast in March 2020, just a week before the
            first Covid lockdown started in Germany. Crowdcast is an online
            platform for running live video events and building a community
            around it. The lockdowns led to a sudden spike in demand for live
            video events, so Crowdcast saw loads of new signups and a
            significant increase in traffic.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The stack Crowdcast was ran on was a client side application written
            in Angular 1.x. and a monolithic API written in Node.js (express),
            both hosted on Heroku.
          </p>

          <p>
            During that time there were two main data stores: Firebase realtime
            database and a MongoDB cluster. Both of those data stores are
            document-based and they were completely encapsulated from each
            other, so there was no relational integrity and they had to be kept
            in sync using background jobs.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Especially the Firebase realtime database proved itself as a
            bottleneck: Too often we found ourselves in a situation where it
            showed 100% load and became unresponsive, meaning that any requests
            relying on it could not be served anymore. And it could not be
            scaled up any further, their “pay-as-you-go” plan was the only
            option they offered.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Weve already spend a serious amount of time trying to mitigate the
            issue by using caching but the core problem remained: Firebase would
            eventually reach 100% capacity and block any new requests for a
            couple of minutes.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            From a business perspective this was a nightmare for us. Running an
            online live event platform we needed to ensure full availability
            around the clock. If we had one high-scale event (more than 10k live
            users was usually considered our danger zone), this could bring down
            the entire platform for a couple of minutes and thus affect all live
            events that were running during that time period. So we decided to
            rewrite the entire application from scratch using a more modern
            technology stack that would meet our requirements and serve us well
            in the future.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            I was given the opportunity to come up with the architecture for
            that new platform. Keeping in mind the scaling problems we were
            experiencing previously, it was essential that this new stack would
            allow us not only to exceed the current traffic requirements but
            also to grow far into the future with us. Our bold goals for
            Crowdcast were live events with more than 100k users, which would be
            a 10x from our current user limit.
